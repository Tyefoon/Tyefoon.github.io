<h2>Week 2 Lab</h2>
<p>Definitions:<br>RFP - An RFP (request for proposal) is a request to vendors to submit a proposal for a product or service your  company wants to purchase. Key parts of an RFP include why your company requires the product or service,  how the product or service will be used, how and when the proposals will be evaluated, and a list of items a  vendor should include in its proposal (for example, a detailed description of its product or service, technical  support, user training, and initial and ongoing costs).

Kindle Edition. <br><br>MOU - An MOU (memorandum of understanding) documents the intentions of two or more parties to enter into a  binding agreement, or contract, and is sometimes used between an informal handshake and the legally binding signatures on contracts. The MOU can be helpful in pushing along contract negotiations and in defining specific concerns of each party, but it is usually not a  legally binding document, does not grant extensive rights to either party, provides no legal recourse, and is not intended to provide thorough coverage of the  agreement to come. West, Jill. CompTIA Network+ Guide to Networks (Mindtap Course List) (p. 78-79). Course Technology Inc. Kindle Edition.<br><br>MSA - An MSA (master service agreement) is a contract that defines the terms of future  contracts between parties, such as payment terms or arbitration arrangements.

Kindle Edition.<br><br>SOW - An SOW (statement of work) documents in detail the work that must be completed for a particular project, and includes specifics such as tasks, deliverables,  standards, payment schedule, and work timeline. An SOW is legally binding,  meaning it can be enforced in a court of law. Many times, an SOW is used to  define the terms of each new project as an addendum to an existing MSA.

Kindle Edition.<br><br>SLA - An SLA (service-level agreement) is a legally binding contract or part of a contract that defines, in plain language and in measurable terms, the aspects of a  service provided to a customer, such as the service provided by an ISP. Details  specified might include contract duration (minimum or maximum), guaranteed  uptime, options for compensation if outages exceed defined thresholds, problem management, performance benchmarks, and termination options. 

    West, Jill. CompTIA Network+ Guide to Networks (Mindtap Course List) (p. 79). Course Technology Inc. Kindle Edition.<br><br>MLA - An MLA (master license agreement) grants a license from a creator, developer, or producer, such as a software producer, to a third party for the purposes of marketing, sublicensing, or distributing the product to  consumers as a stand-alone product or as part of another product.
